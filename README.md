Code, data, and figures for occupancy analysis. This will be the focus of Chapter 1 of my PhD dissertation.

Includes supplementary materials for Kroll et al 2015 and Garcia et al 2020. These materials should help build and inform the 2023-2024 occupancy modelling. 

Goals:

1. Temporal. Model occupancy over time, using both pre-fire and post-fire data.
2. Spatial. Model occupancy across treatments, using just 2023-2024 data.
3. Habitat. Investigate relationship between downed wood and occupancy.

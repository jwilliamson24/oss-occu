Code, data, and figures for occupancy analysis for the Oregon Slender Salamander project spanning 2013-present. 
This will be the focus of Chapter 1 of my PhD dissertation.

Includes supplementary materials for Kroll et al 2015 and Garcia et al 2020. These materials should help build and inform the 2023-2024 occupancy modelling. 

Target species: Oregon Slender Salamander (OSS), Ensatina Eschscholzii (ENES)

Goals:

1. Temporal. Model occupancy over time, using both pre-fire and post-fire data collected 2013-2024. Both target species will be modeled separately.
2. Spatial. Model occupancy across treatments, using just 2023-2024 data. Both target species will be modeled separately.
3. Habitat. Investigate relationship between downed wood and occupancy.
